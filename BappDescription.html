<p>This extension passively detects server software version numbers during scanning, spidering etc.</p>

<p>Often the server version is revealed only on error responses, which may not be visible during the normal course of testing.
Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Apache Tomcat/6.0.24 - Error report"</li>
    <li>"Server: Apache/2.2.4 (Unix) mod_perl/2.0.3 Perl/v5.8.8"</li>
    <li>"X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319"</li>
</ul>

<p>Match rules are loaded from a remote tab-delimited file at extension startup. Users can also load their own match rules from a local file or using the BApp GUI. To view the source code or submit new match rules, go to GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/augustd/burp-suite-software-version-checks">https://github.com/augustd/burp-suite-software-version-checks</a></p>

<p>New in version 2.0.0:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Option to consolidate all findings with the same version number into one scanner report</li>
    <li>UI display includes a list of found domains and versions</li>
</ul>

<p>Requires Java version 7+</p>
